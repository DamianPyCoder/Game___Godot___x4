### Controls.
```diff
Press your finger on the ship and move your finger to make it move with you. In case of using a computer, 
you must do the same but using the mouse.

The shot is automatic.

There are three items that will help you during your game, an item that temporarily increases your attack 
capacity with a greater number of shots at the same time, an item that gives you a shield that makes you 
invulnerable, and a third that gives you extra lives.

### Description.
Pokémon is a series of video games developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company under the Pokémon media franchise. It was created by Satoshi Tajiri with assistance from Ken Sugimori, the first games, Pocket Monsters Red and Green, were released in 1996 in Japan for the Game Boy, later released outside of Japan as Pokémon Red and Blue. The main series of role-playing video games (RPGs), referred as the "core series" by their developers, have continued on each generation of Nintendo's handhelds. The most recently released core series game, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, was released on November 18, 2022, for the Nintendo Switch.

The core games are released in generations, each with different Pokémon, storylines, and characters. Remakes of the games are usually released around a decade after the original versions for the latest console at the time. While the main series consists of RPGs developed by Game Freak, many spin-off games based on the series have been developed by various companies, encompassing other genres such as action role-playing, puzzle, fighting, and digital pet games.

Pokémon is estimated to be the largest media franchise, with successful anime series, movies, and merchandise, with spin-off game Pokémon Go having crossed 1 billion mobile game downloads worldwide. By November 24, 2017, more than 300 million Pokémon games had been sold worldwide on handheld and home consoles, across 76 titles, including spin-offs.[5] As of March 2022, the series has sold over 440 million units worldwide.[6] This makes Pokémon the third best-selling video game franchise, behind Nintendo's own Mario franchise, and Tetris.

## CLON BOMBERMAN

### Description.
Bomberman (ボンバーマン, Bonbāman, also briefly known as Dyna Blaster in Europe) is a video game franchise originally developed by Hudson Soft and currently owned by Konami. The original game, also known as Bakudan Otoko (爆弾男), was released in Japan in July 1983 and has since spawned multiple sequels and spin-offs released on numerous platforms, as well as several anime and manga adaptations.

As of 2002, the series has sold over 10 million copies. The most recent iteration, Amazing Bomberman, was released on August 5, 2022 on Apple Arcade.

Most games in the Bomberman franchise largely revolve around two modes of play; single player campaigns where the player must defeat enemies and reach an exit to progress through levels, and multiplayer modes where players must attempt to eliminate each other and be the last one standing. Gameplay involves strategically placing down bombs, which explode in multiple directions after a certain amount of time, in order to destroy obstacles and kill enemies and other players. The player can pick up various power-ups, giving them benefits such as larger explosions or the ability to place more bombs down at a time. The player is killed if they touch an enemy or get caught up in a bomb's explosion, including their own, requiring players to be cautious of their own bomb placement. In addition to the main maze-based Bomberman games, some spin-off titles involve adventure, platformer, puzzle, and kart racing gameplay.

## STITCH ADVENTURE PLATFORM GAME.

### Description.

This game was part of a small gift for a special person for me because she loved this little blue one called Stitch. Is a classical platform game with two levels, because is unfinished. In the future I want to improve the scenarios, the mobility of the character, add more levels with more diversity of scenarios.
